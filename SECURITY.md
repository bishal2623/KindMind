# 🔐 Security Policy — KindMind

KindMind takes security and user safety seriously.  
We appreciate the efforts of the community in helping us identify and
responsibly disclose potential security issues.

## 📢 Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in KindMind, please report it
responsibly.

### Preferred Reporting Method
- Use **GitHub Private Vulnerability Reporting** (recommended)
- Do NOT create a public GitHub issue for security-related problems

This allows us to investigate and address the issue before public disclosure.

---

## 🛡️ Scope of Security

Security considerations apply to:

- Camera and media access features
- AI interaction and response handling
- Emergency Mode functionality
- Client-side data handling
- Any future backend or authentication systems

---

## 📷 Camera & Permission Safety

- Camera access is only requested when explicitly initiated by the user
- No background or hidden recording is performed
- Permission denial is handled gracefully with clear user feedback

---

## 🤖 Responsible AI Use

- The Empathetic AI Companion is designed to provide emotional support, not
  professional medical or legal advice
- Emergency Mode encourages seeking real-world assistance when needed
- AI outputs are constrained to avoid harmful or misleading content

---

## 🔒 Data Privacy

- No sensitive personal data is intentionally collected without user consent
- User-generated content (e.g. mood entries) is intended for private use
- The platform follows a privacy-first design approach

---

## 🕒 Security Updates

Security updates and fixes will be released as soon as reasonably possible
after validation of a reported issue.

## 🤝 Acknowledgements
